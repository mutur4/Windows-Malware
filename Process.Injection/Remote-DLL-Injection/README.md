## Remote DLL Injection 

**Remote DLL Injection** is where we inject into a Remote Process (that we have permissions obviously) and load our malicious DLL in the memory of the remote process. There are different ways that can be used to enumerate/find the correct processes to inject into and this can be done using different API functions as described below.
